focusing on building the Dashboard with the necessary Pivot Tables, charts, and interactivity using slicers. I'll break down the steps to ensure clarity:

## STEP 3 - Design Your Dashboard
Insert Chart:

Salary by Role Chart: Select your PivotTable for Salary by Role, and then go to Insert > Recommended Charts. Choose a Bar Chart or Column Chart for this.
Salary by State Chart: Similarly, select the PivotTable for Salary by State and insert a Bar Chart or Column Chart.
Salary by Size Chart: Use a Pie Chart or Bar Chart for visualizing Salary by Size.
Map Chart:

If you want to use a Map Chart for Salary by State, select the State and Salary data from your PivotTable, and then go to Insert > Maps > Filled Map. Ensure that your state names are recognized by Excel for map generation.
## STEP 4 - Insert Slicers for Interactivity
Insert Slices:

Select a PivotTable (e.g., Salary by Role) and go to Insert > Slicer.
Choose the fields you want to filter by, such as State, Size, or Role.
Repeat this for other PivotTables as needed.
STEP 5 - Apply Design and Color Customizations
Color Customization: Home → Cell Styles or manually color chart elements. Chart Design: Select chart → Chart Tools → Design.

## STEP 6 - Make the Dashboard Interactive
Connect Slicers: Right-click slicer → Report Connections → select all relevant PivotTables. Test Interactivity: Click slicer options to verify filtering updates the dashboard.

## STEP 7 - Insert Dashboard
