## Finals-Lab-Task-3
This portfolio is about learning MySQL by creating and managing a product database. It includes simple tasks like making a table, adding rules, inserting correct data, and changing a field. The goal is to understand how to build and organize a database using basic SQL.
Step by Step Process:
1. ### Create the Table
Make a table named products.
Add three fields:
- id (auto-increment and primary key)
- product_name (text up to 100 characters, cannot be empty)
- price (decimal number)

2. ### Add a Rule
Add a CHECK constraint to make sure the price is more than 0.
3. ### Insert Valid Products
+ Only add products with a positive price:

Tablet – 299.99 

Keyboard – 19.99
